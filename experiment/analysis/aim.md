### Learning Objectives of this Module

In this module, we will be learning about :

   - **Time and Space Complexity** : We will learn about the running time of one iteration, and then extend it to N iterations to complete the sorting process.
   - **Stable Sort** : We will learn about stability of sorting algorithms. Then we will see how Selection Sort is a stable sort.
   - **Comparison with other algorithms** : We will compare Selection Sort with other sorting algorithms and see in which situations Selection Sort is the optimal/not optimal approach to take.
