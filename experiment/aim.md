### Estimated Time

1.5 hour

### Learning Objectives of the Experiment

In this experiment, we will learn about:

   - Given an unsorted array of numbers, generate a sorted array of numbers by applying Selection Sort
   - Demonstrate knowledge of time complexity of Selection Sort by counting the number of operations involved in each iteration.
   - Compare Selection Sort with other sorting algorithms and realise Selection Sort as a stable comparison sorting algorithm.
